## Instructions

- Answer each question below using SQL executed against the **World database**.
- All SQL commands **must be run by you**.
- For each SQL-based question:
  - Include the SQL command in a fenced code block
  - Include a **screenshot** showing the command and its results
- Store screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder and embed them below each answer.

## Question 1

When importing records from `worldPGSQL.sql`, **how many cities were imported**?

### Answer
4079

### Screenshot
_Show evidence of how you determined this (for example, a COUNT query)._

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS city_count
FROM city;
```

## Question 2

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **display each country name along with the name of each language spoken in that country**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT c.Name AS country_name,
       cl.Language AS language
FROM country c
JOIN countrylanguage cl
  ON c.Code = cl.CountryCode
ORDER BY c.Name, cl.Language;
```

## Question 3

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **display each country name along with the name of each official language spoken in that country**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT c.Name AS country_name,
       cl.Language AS language
FROM country c
JOIN countrylanguage cl
  ON c.Code = cl.CountryCode
WHERE cl.IsOfficial = 'T'
ORDER BY c.Name, cl.Language;
```

## Question 4

Consider the following two SQL statements:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM country, countrylanguage
WHERE country.code = countrylanguage.countrycode;
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM country
LEFT OUTER JOIN countrylanguage
ON country.code = countrylanguage.countrycode;
```

**In your own words**, describe what data the **second query returns that the first query does not**.

### Answer
The second query returns all countries, including those that do not have any matching records in the countrylanguage table. The first query only returns countries that have at least one associated language, because it behaves like an inner join.

## Question 5

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **list all different forms of government** found in the data.
Do **not** repeat any form of government more than once.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GovernmentForm
FROM country;
```

## Question 6

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **list all names of cities and countries in one column**.
Label the column **"City or Country Name"**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT Name AS `City or Country Name`
FROM city

UNION

SELECT Name AS `City or Country Name`
FROM country

ORDER BY `City or Country Name`;
```

## Question 7

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **list all countries by name**, along with the **number of languages spoken in each country**.
Be sure to **sort by country name**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT 
    c.Name AS country_name,
    COUNT(cl.Language) AS language_count
FROM country c
LEFT JOIN countrylanguage cl
    ON c.Code = cl.CountryCode
GROUP BY c.Name
ORDER BY c.Name;
```

## Question 8

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **list all languages**, along with the **number of countries where each language is spoken**.
Be sure to **sort by language name**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT 
    cl.Language AS language,
    COUNT(cl.CountryCode) AS country_count
FROM countrylanguage cl
GROUP BY cl.Language
ORDER BY cl.Language;
```

## Question 9

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **list countries that have more than two official languages**, along with the **number of official languages spoken**.

*Hint: There are 8 such countries in this dataset.*

### SQL

```sql
SELECT 
    c.Name AS country_name,
    COUNT(cl.Language) AS official_language_count
FROM country c
JOIN countrylanguage cl
    ON c.Code = cl.CountryCode
WHERE cl.IsOfficial = 'T'
GROUP BY c.Name
HAVING COUNT(cl.Language) > 2;
```

## Question 10

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **find cities where the district value is missing**.

*Hint: Use `LIKE` and the dash (`-`) since some rows use that instead of actual data.*

### SQL

```sql
SELECT Name, District
FROM city
WHERE District IS NULL
   OR District = ''
   OR District LIKE '-';
```

## Question 11

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **calculate the percentage of cities with missing district values**.

*Hint: The result should be approximately 0.4%.*

### SQL

```sql
SELECT 
    (COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM city)) * 100 AS missing_district_percentage
FROM city
WHERE District = '';
```
